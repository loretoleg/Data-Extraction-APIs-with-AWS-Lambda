# Data-Extraction-APIs-with-AWS-Lambda

In this personal project, I delved into the world of data engineering by leveraging AWS Lambda to develop a suite of data extraction APIs. My exploration encompassed not only the creation of serverless functions but also the establishment of HTTPS endpoints to enable seamless integration with web applications.

Using Python and AWS Lambda, I crafted APIs capable of extracting crucial hotel information from Google Places and Booking.com. These APIs empower users to effortlessly retrieve hotel website URLs, ratings, and photos with minimal input, fostering a streamlined data access experience.

One of the highlights of this project was the utilization of AWS Lambda to create HTTPS endpoints, facilitating direct communication between web applications and the serverless functions. This integration opens up a world of possibilities for developers, enabling them to harness the power of cloud-based data extraction in their web applications.

Throughout my journey, I encountered various challenges and opportunities for learning, from API integration to endpoint configuration and optimization. Each step forward solidified my understanding of data engineering principles and reinforced the importance of seamless data access in driving innovation.

By sharing my experiences and insights, I aim to inspire others to explore the vast potential of data engineering and serverless computing. Join me in uncovering the transformative capabilities of AWS Lambda and data extraction APIs in powering the next generation of data-driven applications.
